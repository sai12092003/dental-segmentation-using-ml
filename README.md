# Dental Teeth Segmentation

## Overview

**Dental Teeth Segmentation** is a Python-based project designed to assist dentists in detecting cavities through advanced image segmentation. The software utilizes ultra-analytical models to analyze dental images and accurately identify cavities, providing a cavity number as output. This tool enhances the accuracy of cavity detection and helps dentists make informed decisions quickly.

## Features

- **Cavity Detection:** Automatically identifies and segments cavities in dental images.
- **Ultra-Analytical Models:** Employs advanced machine learning models for high precision.
- **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated with existing dental imaging systems for real-time analysis.
- **Python-Based:** Developed in Python, making it easily extensible and customizable.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

'''bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dental-teeth-segmentation.git 
 cd dental-teeth-segmentation 
 
 ## 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

'''bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Ultra-Analyticals and Other Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages, including the ultra-analytical models:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add the following to your requirements.txt if it's not already included:

plaintext
Copy code
ultra-analyticals==1.2.3
numpy
pandas
opencv-python
4. Update app.py for Your Environment
Ensure that your app.py is configured with the correct model paths and parameters. Here is a basic structure:

python
Copy code
import ultra_analyticals as ua
import cv2

# Load the model
model = ua.load_model('path_to_your_model')

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_image')

# Run the segmentation
result = model.detect_cavity(image)

# Output the result
print(f"Cavity detected: {result}")
5. Run the Application
Execute the app.py to run the dental teeth segmentation and cavity detection:

'''bash
Copy code
python app.py

#Usage
Image Input: Provide the dental image to the application.
Cavity Detection: The app processes the image and outputs the cavity number.
#Results: Use the output to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.
